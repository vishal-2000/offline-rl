# Metric Space

`Definition (from wikipedia)`: Formally, metric space is an ordered pair $(X, d)$ where $M$ is a set and $d$ is a metric on $M$ i.e., a function $d: M \times M \rightarrow \R$ satisfying all of the following points for $x, y, z \in M$.
1. The distance from point to itself is zero: $d(x, x) = 0$
2. (Positivity) The distance between two distinct points is always positive: $\text{If } x\neq y \text{ then, }d(x, y) \geq 0$
3. (Symmetry) The distance from $x$ to $y$ is same as the distance between $y$ to $x$
4. (Triangle Inequality) The triangle inequality holds: $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$
