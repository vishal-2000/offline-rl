# Linear Map

Also called linear transformation. 


`Definition (Wikipedia):` Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces over the same field $K$. A function $f: V \rightarrow W$ is said to be a linear map if for any two vectors $u, v \in V$ and any scalar $c \in K$, the following two conditions are satisfied:
1. `Additivity` (operation of addition): $f(u+v) = f(u) + f(v)$
2. `Homogeneity` (operation of scalar multiplication): $f(cu) = c f(u)$
